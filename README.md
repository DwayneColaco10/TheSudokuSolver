# Sudoku Solver in C++

This is a simple Sudoku solver implemented in C++. The solver uses the backtracking algorithm to find the solution to a given Sudoku puzzle.

## How to Use

1. Compile and run the C++ code using a C++ compiler of your choice.
2. The program will prompt you to enter the values for the Sudoku board one by one.
3. Enter the numbers row by row, and if you make a mistake, the program will allow you to re-enter a different number for that cell.
4. After entering the initial board, the program will display the unsolved Sudoku puzzle.
5. The Sudoku solver will then attempt to find a solution for the puzzle.
6. If a solution is found, the solved Sudoku board will be displayed.

## Code Explanation

The C++ code uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It checks for each empty cell if a number can be placed in that cell. If a valid number is found, the solver moves on to the next empty cell. If no valid number can be placed in the current cell, the algorithm backtracks to the previous empty cell and tries a different number.
